The August PowerBlock is absolutely going to be a well attended event. We are gong to have an all-star lineup, of highly qualified automation engineers, including Ariel Sanchez, Tom Gillaspy, Chris McClanahan, Dale Hassinger and our powerblock discussing a variety of topics.
 
Here is the general outline for the conversation:

* How do you get started with automation?
* What does success look like?
* What are some of the common mistakes / misperceptions when getting started with automation?
* What are some examples of customer success using vRealize Automation?
